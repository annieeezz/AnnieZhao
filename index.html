        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Annie Zhao and I am a first-year pre-business major. I currently do not have a concentration but I am trying to discover my passion and purpose in the business world. Although I do not have much experience I have joined clubs and business fraternities to expose myself to the business world. I have past experience in leadership roles. In high school, I was Vice President and Representative for two years for the California Scholarship Federation (CSF). I was able to gain experience in public speaking, time management, the ability to adapt to high-pressure situations, and work on team collaboration skills. I was also a Representative for Key Club, which was a volunteering club that helped out our community by aiding other non-profit organizations.<br><br>

        Some organizations I have volunteered for are called Kiwanis and Heart of Compassion. Kiwanis specializes more in the creative and artistic side. Many students get together and we all work on different stations to decorate floats that will be used in the Rose Bowl Parade. This parade would be broadcasted all throughout Southern California on New Year and is an annual event celebrated by many. There would be stations to paint, fill vials with water for the roses, glue down decorations on the floats, outline, and so much more. This was not just a volunteer event but many were able to show off their artistic side. The next organization is called the Heart of Compassion. This focuses on helping the homeless in our community. During Thanksgiving and Christmas Day we would make care packages filled with basic necessities, canned goods, and water. We also helped by serving warm-cooked meals to the homeless or to the less fortunate who cannot afford to buy a turkey or food for their families during the holidays.
